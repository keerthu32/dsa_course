"""A user enters a studentâ€™s marks in 5 subjects

The program calculates:

Total marks

Average marks

Percentage

Grade (based on average)

Whether the student passed or failed
Plan
----------------------------------------
-->to know how many students detail they are going to add
-->get them as input in int then you can get the much information alone
-->first student name
--> they have to enter their mark one by one
--> simantenously adding them
--> then taking average for them with help of counting the marks the enter and
add the elements
--> then taking percentagge (marks obtain/500)*100
-->then assign the grade with average
--> whether student passed or failed
